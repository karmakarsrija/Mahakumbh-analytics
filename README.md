**Mahakumbh 2025 Data Analysis â€“ Overview**
The Mahakumbh 2025 Data Analysis project consolidates and analyzes multiple datasets to understand the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the Mahakumbh festival across different locations and years.

The analysis brings together key metrics such as:

Visitor trends (domestic vs. international)

Revenue streams (hotel, transport, local businesses, donations)

Environmental indicators (Water Quality Index, waste generated, air pollution levels)

Public sentiment and media coverage (including international media reach and positive sentiment trends)

Infrastructure and safety metrics (public transport availability, crime incidents)

Celebrity and VIP visits

By combining these diverse datasets into a single master table, the analysis reveals:

How visitor numbers and spending patterns have evolved.

Which locations generate the highest revenue and receive the most visitors.

How environmental factors like waste and water quality change over time.

The impact of sentiment and media coverage on international visitors.

The correlation between tourism activity and sustainability factors.

Visualizations such as time trends, scatter plots, bar charts, and correlation matrices help highlight key insights, such as:

Trends in domestic vs. international visitors.

Average spending per visitor by year and location.

Revenue contributions from different sectors.

Environmental trends and their relation to festival scale.

The role of celebrity visits and public transport availability in overall outcomes.

This comprehensive data-driven approach helps planners, policymakers, and stakeholders make informed decisions to balance economic benefits, visitor satisfaction, and sustainability for future Mahakumbh events.
